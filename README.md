# Donut Designer

This project is for finding specific recipes that meet a certain flavour profile goal with the berries you currently have available.

Input the berries you currently have and then select your constraints. The calculator will then find the best donuts that fit your requirements.

You can then save your donuts in a list to access later, choose to subtract that donut's berries from your list, or re-generate with new constraints instead.
